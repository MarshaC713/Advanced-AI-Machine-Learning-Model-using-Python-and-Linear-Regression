Advanced AI &amp; Machine Learning Model using Python and Linear Regression.
🍃I created an Advanced AI and Machine Learning Model using linear regression and python. Linear regression is a statistical method used in Machine Learning for predictive analysis, it is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. In the model below, I have analysed some data and I have trained an AI and Machine Learning model using test data to predict whether y is dependent on x.

🚀Mathematically, we can represent a linear regression as : y = mx+c
where:
y = Dependent Variable (Target variable)
x = Independent Variable (predictor variable)
m = Linear regression coefficient (scale factor to each input value)
c = Intercept of the line (gives an additional degree of freedom)


🍃A positive correlation between the two is best visualised using a scatterplot graph. If a possitive correlation exists, the majority of data points will form a linear pattern trending upwards from left to right, as demarked by the red line below. As you can see a positive correlation was found in this dataset.

🍃I completed the code in Python, on IDE Google colabs (a hosted Jupyter notebook Service) and used Python libraries Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib. Matplotlib is a comprehensive Python library for creating beautiful visualisations in Python such as the scatterplot below. Numpy and Pandas are used to shape arrays (data structures that form containers, storing numbers) into matrixes.
